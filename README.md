# Zettelkasten Repository

[![](.github/screenshot2.png)](https://nextra-docs-template.vercel.app)

Welcome to my Zettelkasten repository! This repository serves as a digital knowledge base organized using the Zettelkasten method. Each note is a self-contained unit of knowledge, interconnected through a network of references and associations.

## What is Zettelkasten?

Zettelkasten, meaning "slip box" in English, is a method of organizing knowledge developed by sociologist Niklas Luhmann. It involves creating small notes, or "Zettels," containing ideas, insights, quotes, and references. These notes are then linked together in a non-linear manner, allowing for the emergence of new connections and insights over time.
