## Arch Sats CashBack

If I had to create a robust codebase, which technologies would I choose?

This is an exercise in imagination, where I try to predict the technologies I would use to create a cashback project.
It would require a Landing Page, a Web App, and a Mobile App.
In addition to a robust backend dedicated to microservices.
