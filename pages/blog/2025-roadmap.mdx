I should write more, and it's definitely something I plan to improve in 2025.

Since I have a full-time, in-person job, I have less time to focus on other things, but every day I feel like I should be doing more or at least sharing more about what's going on in my life.

For now, I just want to jot down some bullet points for things I want to achieve in 2025.

I've never really thought about the New Year holidays with nostalgia, reflecting on what I should change. But in 2024, I decided to give it a try and set some goals to work towards. I truly believe that visualizing my goals makes them clearer
