## Stuff that I learned from the video

### 1. Get into coding for fun

Start coding as a hobby and enjoy the process.

### 2. Do hackathons:

- **Solve real problems**: Address actual issues in the community.
- **Ship a product fast**: Launch quickly and gain market traction.
- **Connect with the community**: Network and meet people with similar
  interests.
- **Use to come up with the idea**:
  - **Scratch from your own itch**: Solve problems that you personally face.
  - **Take your time to ideate**: Brainstorm and refine your ideas.
  - **Build a solution that you need**: Create a product that you would use
    yourself.

### 3. Marketing ideas:

- **Build in public**: Share new updates and developments on Twitter with your
  audience.
- **Use small video demos**: Showcase the product in action and tease potential
  users.
- **Focus on community and shareable feelings**: Engage with your community and
  create shareable content.
- **Antispam strategy**: Implement transactional emails and newsletter content.
- **Build trust with your users**: Establish a trustworthy relationship with
  your audience.
- **Focus less on paid ads and more on referrals**.

  with your users.
