### About Me

Greetings! I'm Yan, a versatile creator with a fervent passion for both design and development. My journey into the
world of technology began in the tranquil countryside of Jequi√©, where my curiosity led me to explore the intricacies of
design through freelance projects. However, it wasn't long before I found myself captivated by the limitless
possibilities of software development.

Transitioning from design to development was a gradual yet exhilarating process for me. As I delved deeper into the
realm of coding, I discovered a boundless passion for building innovative solutions and bringing ideas to life through
lines of code. Embracing the role of a generalist, I've cultivated a diverse skill set that allows me to adapt to
various challenges and explore new horizons in the ever-evolving landscape of technology.

While my expertise spans across multiple domains, my curiosity knows no bounds. I'm particularly intrigued by the
transformative potential of Web 3 and blockchain technology. Eager to explore this fascinating frontier, I'm committed
to delving deeper into the complexities of decentralized systems and uncovering the myriad opportunities they present
for innovation and collaboration.

Join me on this exhilarating journey as we push the boundaries of what's possible, harnessing the power of technology to
shape a brighter future for generations to come. Together, let's embark on a quest for knowledge and discovery, fueled
by passion, curiosity, and a relentless desire to make a meaningful impact in the world.
