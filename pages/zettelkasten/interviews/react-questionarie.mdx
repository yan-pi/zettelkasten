### 1. What is React?

React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data
changes. React does this by utilizing a component-based architecture, where the UI is broken down into small, reusable
pieces.

### 2. Explain JSX

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML. JSX allows
developers to write HTML elements directly within JavaScript code, making it easier to create and visualize the
structure of the UI. Under the hood, JSX is transformed into JavaScript calls to React.createElement().

### 3. What is the virtual DOM?

The virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM. React uses the virtual DOM to optimize
updates to the actual DOM. When the state of a component changes, React updates the virtual DOM, then compares it with a
snapshot of the previous virtual DOM. This process, known as reconciliation, allows React to determine the minimal set
of changes needed to update the actual DOM efficiently.

### 4. What are keys in React?

Keys are unique identifiers assigned to elements in a list. They help React identify which items have changed, been
added, or removed. Using keys improves the efficiency of the rendering process, as it allows React to quickly match
elements in the virtual DOM with their corresponding elements in the actual DOM.

### 5. What are state and props in React?

State and props are two types of data that control a component's output in React.

- **State**: Managed within the component (private) and can change over time, usually in response to user actions.
- **Props**: Short for properties, these are read-only and passed from a parent component to a child component. They are
  used to pass data and event handlers to child components.

### 6. What are the differences between state and props in React?

- **State**: Local to the component and can be modified using setState().
- **Props**: Passed from parent to child components and are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed by the receiving
  component.

### 7. Explain the concept of lifting state up

Lifting state up is a pattern where the state is moved to the closest common ancestor component that needs to share this
state. This allows sibling components to communicate and share data through their common parent, which manages the
state.

### 8. What is the purpose of setState in React?

setState is a method used to update a component's state. When setState is called, React schedules a re-render of the
component, which allows the UI to reflect the new state.

### 9. What is React Router?

React Router is a library for routing in React applications. It enables the creation of single-page applications with
navigation, allowing users to move between different views or pages without reloading the entire page.

### 10. Explain the use of useEffect

useEffect is a hook that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. Examples of side effects include
data fetching, setting up subscriptions, and manually changing the DOM. useEffect takes a function that will run after
the render and optionally an array of dependencies that determine when the effect should re-run.

### 11. What are Controlled Components?

Controlled components are those that do not maintain their own state; instead, they receive their value and any updates
via props. In forms, this means the component's state is controlled by React, making it easier to manage and validate
form data.

### 12. What is Redux and how do you use it?

Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications. It provides a central store to hold the state and uses
actions and reducers to manage state changes predictably. To use Redux, you:

1. Create a store with createStore.
2. Define reducers to handle actions.
3. Dispatch actions to update the state.
4. Use the Provider component to make the store available to your React components.
5. Connect components to the store using connect or useSelector and useDispatch hooks.

### 13. Explain the concept of Higher-Order Component

A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props or
functionality. HOCs are used for code reuse, logic abstraction, and enhancing components with additional behavior.

### 14. What is the purpose of the useReducer hook?

The useReducer hook is an alternative to useState for managing complex state logic in functional components. It works
similarly to reducers in Redux, taking a reducer function and an initial state, and returning the current state and a
dispatch function to update the state.

### 15. What is the purpose of key attributes in a list in React?

Keys help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed. This improves the efficiency of rendering
lists by allowing React to track elements between updates and only re-render what is necessary.

### 16. What is the difference between class components and functional components?

- **Class components**: Use ES6 classes, can hold state, and have lifecycle methods.
- **Functional components**: Are simpler, use functions, and utilize hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect) for state and
  lifecycle management.

### 17. Explain the concept of refs in React

Refs provide a way to access the DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method. They are often used to manage
focus, text selection, or media playback, as well as to integrate with third-party libraries.

### 18. What are React hooks?

React hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Hooks such as
useState, useEffect, and useContext allow you to manage state, side effects, and context without writing class
components.

### 19. Explain the use of the useContext hook

The useContext hook allows you to access the context in functional components. Context provides a way to pass data
through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

### 20. What is dangerouslySetInnerHTML in React?

dangerouslySetInnerHTML is a React prop that allows you to set HTML directly from a string. It is similar to using
innerHTML in the DOM but is considered dangerous because it can expose your application to cross-site scripting (XSS)
attacks if not handled properly.

### 21. What is the purpose of componentDidMount in the lifecycle method?

componentDidMount is a lifecycle method in class components that runs after the component is mounted to the DOM. It is
commonly used for initializing data, setting up subscriptions, or making network requests.

### 22. What are React DevTools?

React DevTools is a browser extension that allows you to inspect the React component hierarchy, view props and state,
and debug applications. It provides a visual representation of the component tree and helps in identifying performance
bottlenecks.

### 23. Explain the concept of context in React

Context in React provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every
level. It is useful for global data like themes, authentication status, or preferred language.

### 24. What are the advantages of using React?

- **Component-based architecture**: Encourages reusability and modularity.
- **Virtual DOM**: Enhances performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulations.
- **Declarative syntax**: Simplifies the process of building dynamic UIs.
- **Strong community and ecosystem**: Provides numerous libraries and tools for development.

### 25. How does React handle prop drilling?

React handles prop drilling by using context to pass data through the component tree without manually passing props at
every level. Libraries like Redux or hooks like useContext also help manage state and avoid excessive prop drilling.

### 26. What is the purpose of shouldComponentUpdate in the lifecycle method?

shouldComponentUpdate is a lifecycle method that determines whether a component should re-render when its state or props
change. By default, it returns true, but you can override it to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary renders.

### 27. Explain React Fragments

React Fragments let you group multiple elements without adding an extra node to the DOM. This is useful for returning
multiple elements from a component's render method without wrapping them in a parent element.

### 28. Explain the key prop in React Router

The key prop in React Router is used to force a remount of a component when its key changes. This can be useful for
scenarios where you need to reset the component state or trigger a re-render when navigating between routes.

### 29. What is the purpose of forwardRef in React?

forwardRef is a function that lets you pass a ref through a component to one of its children. It is useful for accessing
the ref of a child component, especially when building reusable components that need to expose a DOM node.

### 30. Explain the concept of error boundaries in React

Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those
errors, and display a fallback UI. They help prevent errors from crashing the entire application.

### 31. Explain the concept of memo in React

React.memo is a higher-order component that memoizes a functional component, preventing it from re-rendering unless its
props change. This optimization helps improve performance by reducing unnecessary renders.

### 32. How does React handle forms?

React handles forms using controlled components, where the form elements' values are managed by the component state.
This approach makes it easier to handle user input, validation, and submission.

### 33. Explain the useMemo hook

useMemo is a hook that memoizes the result of a computation based on its dependencies. It helps optimize performance by
avoiding expensive calculations on every render unless the dependencies change.

### 34. Explain the useCallback hook

useCallback is a hook that returns a memoized version of a callback function. It is useful for preventing unnecessary
re-renders of child components that depend on callback functions

as props.

### 35. Explain the concept of Suspense in React

Suspense is a React component that allows you to suspend rendering while waiting for some asynchronous operation to
complete, such as data fetching. It can be used with React.lazy to dynamically load components or with concurrent
features to manage complex loading states.
