Welcome to my Zettelkasten! This repository/documentation contains a collection of interconnected notes on various
topics, but mostly about engineering and software development. Whether you're here to explore ideas, seek inspiration,

## What is a Zettelkasten?

A Zettelkasten (German for "slip box" or "note box") is a knowledge management system based on interconnected notes.
Each note, or "zettel," contains a single idea or concept, and these notes are linked together through references and
connections. The goal of a Zettelkasten is to facilitate the exploration of ideas, encourage serendipitous discoveries,
and support the development of new insights through the process of associative thinking.
