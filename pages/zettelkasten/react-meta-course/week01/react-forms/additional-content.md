Here is a list of additional resources for Module 1, Lesson 3 (Forms in React):

- [Forms from the official React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html) illustrate some examples of how React deals
  with certain form fields compared to traditional HTML tags, like the text area, select and file input tags. It also
  showcases how to handle multiple inputs by leveraging event.target.name and the implications of using null as a value
  in a controlled input.

- [Formik](https://formik.org/) is the most popular open source form library for React. It saves you lots of time when
  building forms and offers a declarative, intuitive and adoptable paradigm.

- [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) is an open-source library that integrates perfectly with Formik. It allows you
  to set all your form validation rules declaratively.

- [React-hook-form](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form) is another popular library to easily manage your
  form state and validation rules.
