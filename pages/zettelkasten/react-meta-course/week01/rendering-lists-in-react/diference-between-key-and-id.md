In React, both `key` and `id` are used to identify elements in a list, but they serve different purposes and have
different uses:

1. **`key`**:
   - The `key` property is specific to React and is used to help React uniquely identify each element in a list. Each
     element in a list should have a unique `key`.
   - The primary purpose of `key` is to optimize performance and rendering efficiency. When an element is added,
     removed, or rearranged in a list, React uses the `key` to understand which elements have changed and update only
     the relevant elements, rather than re-rendering the entire list.
   - `key` is typically used in React components when you map over a list to render elements.

Example of using `key`:

```jsx
const friends = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Alice' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Bob' },
  { id: 3, name: 'Charlie' },
];

const friendList = friends.map((friend) => <div key={friend.id}>{friend.name}</div>);
```

2. **`id`**:
   - The `id` property is a convention commonly used in HTML and many other contexts to provide a unique identification
     to an element.
   - In React components, you can use `id` in the same way as in any other context to identify an element, but it does
     not take advantage of React's internal optimizations for lists.
   - The use of `id` is not specific to rendering lists and is not used by React to optimize element updates in lists as
     `key` is.

Example of using `id`:

```jsx
const friends = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Alice' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Bob' },
  { id: 3, name: 'Charlie' },
];

const friendList = friends.map((friend) => <div id={friend.id}>{friend.name}</div>);
```

Therefore, the main difference between `key` and `id` in React is that `key` is used specifically for list optimization
and ensuring efficient rendering of elements in a list, while `id` is a general identifier that can be used for any
purpose but does not provide the same rendering optimizations.
