## How to Build a Profitable Personal Brand (In Just 30 Days)

This post is inspired by Matt Gray’s YouTube video: [How to Build a Profitable Personal Brand (In Just 30 Days)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dn7x0Sr2IhY).

- Become the face of your company or brand.
- You should be the person that connects customers, opportunities, community, and cash flow.

## The Blueprint

Brand System - Core Team - Monetization - Audience Growth System - Compounding Content

### Brand System

Are you intentionally growing your brand? Are you intentionally leveraging it to grow your business?

#### How to Create a Personal Brand that Attracts Your Customers

You need to visualize:

Vision - Mission - Values - Goals - Content categories - Content ideas - Target market - Content IP

What is your one-sentence pitch that outlines:

- What does your brand do?
- Why does your company do it?
- How does your company do it?

Your brand’s values should determine your tone, voice, and personality to target the right audience.

> **Tip**: Ask people in your niche to give you feedback about your brand and what they want to see.
> 
> - What are their biggest challenges?
> - What are their biggest aspirations?
> - What questions do they have about the industry in which you operate?
> - If they could wave a magic wand, what would be their biggest accomplishment for this year?

The answers to these questions will provide you with the content ideas you need to create.

Now that you know who your target market is, define your four content categories. These are the themes for which people will know and love you.

For example, a marketing niche focused on entrepreneurship could include:
Scaling - Content Creation Systems - Personal Branding - Audience Growth System

#### Content IP

This is a consistent element present in every piece of content you create. Think of Daniel Dalen’s thumbnails, Matt D'Avella’s editing style, or Gary Vee’s voice.

You need to associate this unique element with your brand. As your brand grows, this will become increasingly recognizable.

You can do the same with your naming style, editing style, voice, etc.

## Content Waterfall

Choose the two best platforms for you to focus on, and post twice a day. It’s better to excel on two platforms than to be mediocre on five.

> **Tip**: If you’re unsure, focus on X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn. These are the best platforms for brand building because they reach real entrepreneurs.

To engage with your audience, you need to be consistent and authentic.

The foundation of the *Content Waterfall* is to create a pillar or main piece of content, then break it down into smaller pieces.

The main piece of content is the source of the waterfall, while the smaller pieces are the streams that branch out from it.

These could be blog posts, X threads, podcasts, YouTube videos, etc.

Focus on content that inspires, educates, entertains, makes people think, and triggers emotions.

## Audience Growth System

Schedule dedicated time for content creation. Content creation is an exercise—the more you do it, the better you become.

Write down 10 content ideas every day, then pick the best one to develop in a particular format.

Execute, optimize, and repeat.

## Monetization

This is essential for investing in your brand. You need a clear monetization strategy. CTAs (calls to action) are crucial for this. Every piece of content you create should include a CTA.

> **Examples**: Subscribe, follow, share, or buy.

CTAs turn followers into customers.

## Core Team

Here’s where scaling comes in. As you grow, you’ll need a team to help you manage your brand.

Look for people who excel at what you don’t. You need “weapons” to fight the business war, and your team is your weapon.

A “weapon” is someone with 10x ability in their area of expertise.

Look for talent in areas like sales, video production, photography, design, writing, funnel creation, animation, operations, video editing, social media, etc.
