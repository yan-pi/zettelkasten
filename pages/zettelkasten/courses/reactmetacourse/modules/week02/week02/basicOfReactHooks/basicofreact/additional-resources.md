Below is a list of additional resources as you continue to explore React hooks and custom hooks.

In particular, to complement your learning in the “Getting started with hooks” lesson, you can work through the following:

- The article on [destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) assignment describes how the destructuring assignment, which allows you to get values out of the array that gets returned when the useState hook is invoked, works in more detail. 
    
- [The read props inside the child component](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#step-2-read-props-inside-the-child-component) link on the Beta version of React docs discusses how to use destructuring assignment to get values out of the props object. 
    
- The [useState reference on official React docs website](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useState#usestate) helps you understand how to work with this hook and some of the caveats involved. 
    
- The [useEffect reference on official React docs website](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useEffect#useeffect) helps you understand the syntax of this hook and goes into some depth to explain how to use and troubleshoot the useEffect hook.
