## How to Transform Data in JavaScript with the map() Method

### Introduction

Lists are a common feature in almost every app, and JavaScript provides a powerful tool for transforming them: the `map()` method. This method allows you to iterate over each element in a list and apply a transformation to it, returning a new list with the transformed elements.

### Example

Imagine that a restaurant called Little Lemon would like to display a list of its popular desserts. Each dessert has the following properties: id, title, image, description, and price. Little Lemon would like to show a very simple list of desserts with a property called content, which is a combination of the title and description and the price of the delicious dish.

To do this, Little Lemon can use the `map()` method to transform the original list of desserts into a new list with a content property. The following code shows how to do this:

JavaScript

``` js
const data = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Chocolate Lava Cake",
    image: "https://example.com/chocolate-lava-cake.jpg",
    description: "A rich and decadent chocolate cake with a molten chocolate center.",
    price: 10.99,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: "Tiramisu",
    image: "https://example.com/tiramisu.jpg",
    description: "A classic Italian dessert made with ladyfingers dipped in espresso and layered with a creamy mascarpone filling.",
    price: 8.99,
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    title: "Apple Pie",
    image: "https://example.com/apple-pie.jpg",
    description: "A classic American dessert made with a flaky crust and sweet, juicy apples.",
    price: 7.99,
  },
];

const topDesserts = data.map((dessert) => {
  return {
    content: `${dessert.title} - ${dessert.description} (${dessert.price})`,
    price: dessert.price,
  };
});

console.log(topDesserts);
```

### Conclusion

The map() method is a powerful tool for transforming data in JavaScript. It allows you to iterate over each element in a list and apply a transformation to it, returning a new list with the transformed elements. This can be useful for a variety of tasks, such as filtering, sorting, and transforming data to a different format.
