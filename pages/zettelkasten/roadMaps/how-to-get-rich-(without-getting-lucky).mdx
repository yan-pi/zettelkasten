1. **Seek wealth, not money or status.**

   - Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep.
   - Money is how we transfer time and wealth.
   - Status is your place in the social hierarchy.

2. **Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible.**

   - If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you.

3. **Ignore people playing status games.**

   - They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.

4. **You’re not going to get rich renting out your time.**

   - You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.

5. **You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get.**

   - At scale.

6. **Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people.**

7. **The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers.**

   - Most people haven't figured this out yet.

8. **Play iterated games.**

   - All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.

9. **Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity.**

10. **Don't partner with cynics and pessimists.**

    - Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.

11. **Learn to sell. Learn to build.**

    - If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.

12. **Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.**

    - **Specific knowledge** is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone
      else, and replace you.
    - **Specific knowledge** is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right
      now.
    - Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.
    - When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools.
    - Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.

13. **Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name.**

    - Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.

14. **The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands:**
    - Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon.
